# pi-kiosk-setup

Interactive first-boot wizard for Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm / Trixie, labwc).

The repo must be **public**. Then, on the Pi:

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Visivalab/pi-kiosk/master/kiosk.sh | sudo bash

That downloads only `kiosk.sh`. The script then fetches the rest of the tree
and gives the wizard access to `/dev/tty` so the rotation prompt still works.

Or copy this folder to a Pi / clone it there, then:

    sudo ./kiosk.sh

To run the standalone totem registration flow later from a checkout:

    PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pi_kiosk register-totem

Or directly from GitHub on the Pi:

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Visivalab/pi-kiosk/master/kiosk.sh | sudo bash -s -- register-totem

It asks these interactive questions:

1. Screen rotation
2. RustDesk unattended password
3. GitHub repo for the kiosk webapp
4. Whether to open the kiosk app immediately after setup

Then it applies the rest and prints what it did after each step.

If a Wayland desktop session is available, rotation is also applied live and
saved for future graphical logins.

This is not an image builder. Flash stock Raspberry Pi OS Desktop 64-bit
with Imager, boot normally, run the command.

## What v1 does

1. Screen rotation selector:
   - No rotation
   - Rotate clockwise (90°)
   - Rotate counterclockwise (90°)
2. Disable screen blanking / sleep
3. Desktop autologin (no password prompt on boot)
4. RustDesk installation and unattended-access setup:
   - installs the latest official RustDesk `.deb`
   - sets the unattended-access password you provide
   - prints the generated RustDesk ID
5. Webapp kiosk deployment from a public GitHub repo:
   - downloads the repo archive
   - deploys `build/`, or `dist/` if `build/` is missing
   - serves the static app locally with `python3 -m http.server`
   - launches Chromium in kiosk mode on graphical login
   - installs a labwc cursor-hide keybind and, when `wtype` and `swayidle`
     are available, re-hides the mouse cursor after idle

The account password is not deleted. It is still used for SSH and sudo.

## Standalone totem registration

The installer does not register anything remotely. Use the separate command when
you want to register the device in your dashboard/backend:

    PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pi_kiosk register-totem

If you are not inside a checkout on the Pi, use the pipeable form instead:

    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Visivalab/pi-kiosk/master/kiosk.sh | sudo bash -s -- register-totem

That command:

- detects the machine name from the system hostname
- asks for the totem name
- asks for the totem description
- asks for the totem location
- sends a `POST` to your configured registration endpoint
- installs an hourly systemd timer that reports raw runtime facts to the backend

The hourly reporter sends:

- `kiosk_running`: `true` when `labwc` is running for the desktop user
- `webapp_running`: `true` when `127.0.0.1:8080` is answering

Configure the endpoint and token in [src/pi_kiosk/totem_registration.py](/mnt/c/Users/Nitropc/orca/pi-kiosk/src/pi_kiosk/totem_registration.py)
or override them with:

- `PI_KIOSK_REGISTER_TOTEM_URL`
- `PI_KIOSK_REGISTER_TOTEM_TOKEN`

The hourly status reporter reuses `PI_KIOSK_REGISTER_TOTEM_TOKEN`. Its status
URL is inferred from `PI_KIOSK_REGISTER_TOTEM_URL` by replacing the final
`register-totem` path segment with `totem-status`.

## What it will not do

- It refuses to run on a non-Raspberry Pi. Safe to invoke by mistake.
- It refuses to run without sudo.
- It does not build frontend code on the Pi with npm/node.
- It does not handle private GitHub repos yet.
- It does not configure a custom RustDesk server.
- It does not disable touch input devices; it only maps touch when needed.

## Layout

- `src/pi_kiosk/app.py` — wizard loop. Add a step here, not by forking the CLI.
- `src/pi_kiosk/steps/` — one module per concern (rotation, touch, nosleep, autologin, RustDesk, webapp kiosk).
- `src/pi_kiosk/host.py` — system port. Tests use an in-memory fake.
- `src/pi_kiosk/linux.py` — the only code that touches a real machine.

Re-running is safe: tagged blocks in `~/.config/labwc/autostart` are replaced,
not duplicated.

## Tests

    make test

Tests never talk to raspi-config or write labwc files on the machine that
runs them.
