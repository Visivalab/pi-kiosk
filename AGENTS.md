# AGENTS.md — pi-kiosk-setup

Guidance for coding agents working in this repository.

## Scope and working copy

- Canonical checkout: `/home/gerard/projects/pi-kiosk-setup`
- Not a GitHub repo yet. Do not invent a remote or push unless asked.
- This tool is meant to run on **other** Raspberry Pis, never on the VPS that hosts this checkout.
- Do not run `sudo ./kiosk.sh` or `python3 -m pi_kiosk` against a real host unless the user explicitly wants a live Pi configured. Tests use an in-memory fake.

## What this project does

Interactive first-boot wizard for Raspberry Pi OS Desktop (Bookworm / Trixie, labwc).

v1 asks one question (screen rotation), then always:

1. Writes a labwc `wlr-randr` rotation block
2. Disables screen blanking / sleep
3. Enables desktop autologin (`raspi-config` B4)

Autologin does not delete the account password. SSH and sudo still use it.

Not in v1: Chromium kiosk, touch remap, RustDesk. Those are extra steps, not a rewrite.

```

## Development rules

- Python 3 stdlib only. No pip, venv, or extra packages.
- TDD: failing test first for new behavior. `make test` must stay green.
- Add features as a new class in `src/pi_kiosk/steps/` with `id`, `title`, `choices`, `ask()`, `apply()`. Register it in `default_steps()`.
- Do not put raspi-config or filesystem calls in the wizard. Steps talk to `Host`.
- Re-runs must be idempotent. User-facing files use `# pi-kiosk-setup:<name>-begin/end` blocks.
- Rotation names: `none` (0), `clockwise` (90), `counterclockwise` (270).
- Stay on Wayland/labwc. Do not switch the Pi back to X11.
- Do not commit, deploy, or configure a live Pi unless the user asks.

## Safety

- Refuse non-Pi machines (`looks_like_raspberry_pi`).
- Refuse non-root.
- `LinuxHost` must write labwc files to the desktop user home (`SUDO_USER`), not `/root`.
- A live run on this VPS must exit 2 and change nothing.

## Verification

From the repository root:

```bash
make test
```

That is `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`. Tests must never call real `raspi-config` or write `~/.config/labwc` on the machine that runs them.

After a behavior change, run `make test` and report the real result. Optional extra check: `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pi_kiosk` on a non-Pi must print the refusal and exit 2.
